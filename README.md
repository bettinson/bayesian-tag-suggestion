# About

This uses a naive Bayesian algorithm to suggest a tag/category based on a link specified. You can train the data by putting more information into the `training_links.txt` in the format of `tag1 tag2 tag3 link`

# Todo

Right now, this is only guessing based on specific links. There is no language processing based on the link's title or anything. It's quite limited thus is a proof of concept at the moment.
